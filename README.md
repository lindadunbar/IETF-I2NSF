IETF Interface to Network Security Functions

In a nutshell, I2NSF wants to define interfaces to the flow based network security functions hosted by service providers at different premises. 


Network security functions (NSFs) are provided and consumed in increasingly diverse environments. Users of NSFs could consume network security services hosted by one or more providers, which may be their own enterprise, service providers, or a combination of both. Likewise, service providers of NSFs may offer their customers network security services that consist of multiple security products and/or functions from different vendors. NSFs may be provided by physical and/or virtualized infrastructure. Without standard interfaces to express, monitor, and control security policies that govern the behavior of NSFs, it becomes virtually impossible for security service providers to automate their service offerings that utilize different security functions from multiple vendors. 

This Wiki is for wider community to share implementations, designs, and ideas on how to define proper interfaces to the NSFs
